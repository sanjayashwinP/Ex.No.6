## üèóÔ∏è Introduction

Modern software development has been revolutionized by **AI-assisted coding tools**.
Instead of manually writing large sections of code, developers now collaborate with AI models that:

* Interpret natural language instructions
* Generate functional code snippets
* Debug and optimize programs
* Provide actionable insights from data

This README illustrates a full experimental study showing how progressively improved **prompts** can transform AI-generated results from simple scripts to complex data-driven solutions.

## üí° Concept: Prompt Engineering

**Prompt engineering** is the art of communicating with AI effectively.

A strong prompt typically includes:

* **Context:** The situation or background (e.g., project type, data source)
* **Role:** Defines AI‚Äôs persona (e.g., ‚ÄúAct as a senior Python developer.‚Äù)
* **Task:** The exact problem to solve
* **Constraints:** Conditions like performance, format, or coding standard
* **Expected Output:** Defines what the answer should look like

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stage 1 ‚Äì Basic API Interaction

### üßæ Prompt

```
You are an expert Python developer. Write Python code to connect to two public APIs ‚Äî one for weather data (OpenWeather) and another for air quality (AQICN). Fetch data for a user-given city and display both results.
```

### üíª AI-Generated Code

```python
import requests

def get_weather(city):
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=YOUR_WEATHER_KEY&units=metric"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

def get_air_quality(city):
    url = f"https://api.waqi.info/feed/{city}/?token=YOUR_AQI_KEY"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

city = input("Enter city name: ")
weather = get_weather(city)
aqi = get_air_quality(city)

print("Weather Data:", weather)
print("Air Quality Data:", aqi)
```

### üß† Explanation

This prompt generated a basic Python script to access two APIs and print JSON responses.
Although functional, it lacks error handling and formatted output ‚Äî improved in the next stage.

---

## üßÆ Stage 2 ‚Äì Improved Comparison and Formatting

### üßæ Prompt

```
Refine the code to include error handling, and display results from both APIs in a formatted table with temperature, humidity, and AQI.
```

### üíª AI-Generated Code

```python
import requests
from tabulate import tabulate

def get_data(city):
    try:
        weather_api = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=YOUR_WEATHER_KEY&units=metric"
        aqi_api = f"https://api.waqi.info/feed/{city}/?token=YOUR_AQI_KEY"
        weather = requests.get(weather_api).json()
        air_quality = requests.get(aqi_api).json()

        data = [
            ["City", city],
            ["Temperature (¬∞C)", weather['main']['temp']],
            ["Humidity (%)", weather['main']['humidity']],
            ["Air Quality Index", air_quality['data']['aqi']]
        ]
        print(tabulate(data, headers=["Parameter", "Value"], tablefmt="fancy_grid"))
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)

city = input("Enter city: ")
get_data(city)
```

### üß† Explanation

This stage introduces:

* **Error handling**
* **Data presentation using `tabulate`**
* Clearer readability for real-world usability

---

## üîç Stage 3 ‚Äì Comparative API Analysis

### üßæ Prompt

```
Write Python code that compares outputs from two APIs (OpenWeather and AQICN). If both APIs provide similar data like temperature or humidity, compare and calculate percentage difference.
```

### üíª AI-Generated Code

```python
def compare_temperature(temp1, temp2):
    difference = abs(temp1 - temp2)
    percent_diff = (difference / ((temp1 + temp2) / 2)) * 100
    return percent_diff

temp_api1 = 30.5
temp_api2 = 31.2
print(f"Temperature difference: {compare_temperature(temp_api1, temp_api2):.2f}%")
```

### üß† Explanation

Here, AI introduces mathematical logic to compute differences ‚Äî demonstrating analytical thinking from prompts.

---

## üìä Stage 4 ‚Äì Data Visualization (Graph)

### üßæ Prompt

```
Add code to visualize temperature, humidity, and AQI values using Matplotlib in a bar chart.
```

### üíª AI-Generated Code

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_data(city, temp, humidity, aqi):
    parameters = ['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'AQI']
    values = [temp, humidity, aqi]
    plt.bar(parameters, values, color=['orange', 'blue', 'green'])
    plt.title(f'Weather & AQI Data for {city}')
    plt.xlabel('Parameter')
    plt.ylabel('Value')
    plt.show()

plot_data('Chennai', 32, 70, 140)
```

### üß† Explanation

Visual representation enhances understanding of environmental conditions ‚Äî a crucial improvement for usability.

---

## üßæ Stage 5 ‚Äì AI-Generated Insights

### üßæ Prompt

```
Generate AI insights based on API outputs. For instance, if AQI > 100, suggest staying indoors, else recommend outdoor activity. Output text-based suggestions.
```

### üíª AI-Generated Code

```python
def generate_insights(temp, humidity, aqi):
    insights = []
    if aqi > 100:
        insights.append("Air quality is poor. Avoid outdoor activity.")
    else:
        insights.append("Air quality is good. Safe for outdoor activity.")

    if humidity > 80:
        insights.append("High humidity detected ‚Äî stay hydrated.")
    elif temp > 35:
        insights.append("High temperature ‚Äî avoid peak afternoon hours.")
    else:
        insights.append("Weather conditions are normal.")

    return "\n".join(insights)

print(generate_insights(33, 75, 120))
```

### üß† Explanation

The prompt produced meaningful **textual recommendations**, showing how AI-generated data can assist users in daily planning.

---

## üíæ Stage 6 ‚Äì Data Logging and Automation

### üßæ Prompt

```
Modify the previous code to save all API data and insights to a JSON file with timestamps. Automate this every 2 hours using a scheduler.
```

### üíª AI-Generated Code

```python
import json
import time
from datetime import datetime

def save_data(city, weather, air_quality, insights):
    record = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
        "city": city,
        "weather": weather,
        "air_quality": air_quality,
        "insights": insights
    }
    with open("daily_log.json", "a") as file:
        file.write(json.dumps(record) + "\n")

while True:
    city = "Chennai"
    weather = {"temp": 33, "humidity": 72}
    air_quality = {"aqi": 140}
    insights = generate_insights(33, 72, 140)
    save_data(city, weather, air_quality, insights)
    print("Data logged successfully.")
    time.sleep(7200)  # Runs every 2 hours
```

### üß† Explanation

This demonstrates how prompt-based coding can evolve into automation and data persistence ‚Äî aligning with professional use cases.
